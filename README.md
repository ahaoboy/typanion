# Typanion

> Static and runtime type assertion library with no dependencies

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/typanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/typanion.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/developed%20with-Yarn%202-blue)](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Installation

```
yarn add typanion
```

## Why

- Typanion can validate nested arbitrary data structures
- Typanion is type-safe; it uses [type predicates](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards)
- Typanion allows you to derive types from your schemas
- Typanion can report detailed error reports

Compared to [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), Typanion has a better inference support for TypeScript + supports `isOneOf`. Its functional API makes it very easy to tree shake, which is another bonus (although the library isn't very large in itself).

## Usage

First define a schema using the builtin operators:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});
```

Then just call the schema to validate any `unknown` value:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);

if (isMovie(userData)) {
    console.log(userData.title);
}
```

Passing a second parameter allows you to retrieve detailed errors:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);
const errors: string[] = [];

if (!isMovie(userData, {errors})) {
    console.log(errors);
}
```

You can also apply coercion over the user input:

```ts
const userData = JSON.parse(input);
const coercions: Coercion[] = [];

if (isMovie(userData, {coercions})) {
    // Coercions aren't flushed by default
    for (const [p, op] of coercions) op();

    // All relevant fields have now been coerced
    // ...
}
```

You can derive the type from the schema and use it in other functions:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
});

type Movie = t.InferType<typeof isMovie>;

// Then just use your alias:
const printMovie = (movie: Movie) => {
    // ...
};
```

Schemas can be stored in multiple variables if needed:

```ts
import * as t from 'typanion';

const isActor = t.isObject({
    name: t.isString();
});

const isMovie = t.isObject({
    title: t.isString(),
    description: t.isString(),
    actors: t.isArray(isActor),
});
```

## API

### Type predicates

- `isArray(values)` will ensure that the values are arrays whose values all match the specified schema.

- `isTuple(values)` will ensure that the values are tuples whose items match the specified schemas.

- `isBoolean()` will ensure that the values are all booleans. Prefer `isLiteral` if you wish to specifically check for one of `true` or `false`. This predicate supports coercion.

- `isDate()` will ensure that the values are proper `Date` instances. This predicate supports coercion via either ISO8601, or raw numbers (in which case they're interpreted as the number of *seconds* since epoch, not milliseconds).

- `isDict(values, {keys?})` will ensure that the values are all a standard JavaScript objects containing an arbitrary number of fields whose values all match the given schema. The `keys` option can be used to apply a schema on the keys as well (this will always have to be strings, so you'll likely want to use `applyCascade(isString(), [...])` to define the pattern).

- `isLiteral(value)` will ensure that the values are strictly equal to the specified expected value. It's an handy tool that you can combine with `oneOf` and `object` to parse structures similar to Redux actions, etc.

- `isNumber()` will ensure that the values are all numbers. This predicate supports coercion.

- `isObject(props, {extra?})` will ensure that the values are plain old objects whose properties match the given shape. Extraneous properties will be aggregated and validated against the optional `extra` schema.

- `isString()` will ensure that the values are all regular strings.

- `isUnknown()` will accept whatever is the input without validating it, but without refining the type inference either. Note that by default `isUnknown` will forbid `undefined` and `null`, but this can be switched off by explicitly allowing them via `isOptional` and `isNullable`.

- `isInstanceOf(constructor)` will ensure that the values are instances of a given constructor.

### Helper predicates

- `applyCascade(spec, [specA, specB, ...])` will ensure that the values all match `spec` and, if they do, run the followup validations as well. Since those followups will not contribute to the inference (only the lead schema will), you'll typically want to put here anything that's a logical validation, rather than a typed one (cf the [Cascading Predicates](#Cascading-predicate) section).

- `isOneOf([specA, specB])` will ensure that the values all match any of the provided schema. As a result, the inferred type is the union of all candidates. The predicate supports an option, `exclusive`, which ensures that only one variant matches.

- `isOptional(spec)` will add `undefined` as an allowed value for the given specification.

- `isNullable(spec)` will add `null` as an allowed value for the given specification.

### Cascading predicates

Cascading predicate don't contribute to refining the value type, but are handful to assert that the value itself follows a particular pattern. You would compose them using `applyCascade` (cf the [Examples](#Examples) section).

- `hasExactLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property exactly equal to the specified value.

- `hasForbiddenKeys` will ensure that the objects don't contain any of the specified keys.

- `hasKeyRelationship` will ensure that when the specified key is found, the specified relationship is true.

- `hasMaxLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property at most equal to the specified value.

- `hasMinLength` will ensure that the values all have a `length` property at least equal to the specified value.

- `hasMutuallyExclusiveKeys` will ensure that the objects don't contain more than one of the specified keys.

- `hasRequiredKeys` will ensure that the objects contain all of the specified keys.

- `hasUniqueItems` will ensure that the values only have unique items (`map` will transform before comparing).

- `isAtLeast` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isAtMost` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isBase64` will ensure that the values are valid base 64 data.

- `isHexColor` will ensure that the values are hexadecimal colors (`alpha` will allow an additional channel).

- `isInExclusiveRange` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isInInclusiveRange` will ensure that the values compare positively with the specified value.

- `isInteger` will ensure that the values are round safe integers (`unsafe` will allow [unsafe ones](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isSafeInteger)).

- `isJSON` will ensure that the values are valid JSON, and optionally match them against a nested schema.

- `isLowerCase` will ensure that the values only contain lowercase characters.

- `isNegative` will ensure that the values are at most 0.

- `isPositive` will ensure that the values are at least 0.

- `isISO8601` will ensure that the values are dates following the ISO 8601 standard.

- `isUpperCase` will ensure that the values only contain uppercase characters.

- `isUUID4` will ensure that the values are valid UUID 4 strings.

- `matchesRegExp` will ensure that the values all match the given regular expression.

## Examples

Validate that an unknown value is a port protocol:

```ts
const isPort = t.applyCascade(t.isNumber(), [
    t.isInteger(),
    t.isInInclusiveRange(1, 65535),
]);

isPort(42000);
```

Validate that a value contains a specific few fields, regardless of the others:

```ts
const isDiv = t.isObject({
    tagName: t.literal(`DIV`),
}, {
    extra: t.isUnknown(),
});

isDiv({tagName: `div`, appendChild: () => {}});
```

Validate that a specific field is a specific value, and that others are all numbers:

```ts
const isModel = t.isObject({
    uid: t.String(),
}, {
    extra: t.isDict(t.isNumber()),
});

isModel({uid: `foo`, valA: 12, valB: 24});
```
